                                        get a chance to express themselves, on a topic of their interests (cultural, technical, literary, political, etc.). It helped
                                        the students grow, analyze their strengths and weaknesses about public speaking, develop their personalities and enhance
                                        leadership qualities in them. Best participant has been promised a chance to perform in "Spring Fest Jamia '19" organized
                                        by CSI-JMI in the month of March, along with a cash prize.

                                        </h5>

                                        <p>
                                            For accelerated economic growth, massive investments are needed in all sectors. Industry and corporates will require engineers/technologists
                                            in large numbers. As several studies have shown, most of the engineers/technologists
                                            passing out from technical institutions do not have practical skills to take
                                            up jobs in industry and require pre-job training. Many companies have to deploy
                                            large amount of funds, time and internal resources in locating, recruiting, training
                                            and in trying to retain talent in the absence of availability of 'industry ready'
                                            manpower directly from academic institutions in adequate numbers and quality.
                                            All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has recently decided that,
                                            starting from 2017-18, the engineering students should undergo internship training
                                            before taking up jobs, in a manner somewhat similar to medical graduates, so
                                            that they can gain practical skills and experience and suitably fit in the desired
                                            roles in industry. For this purpose, a major initiative has been taken by AICTE
                                            by partnering with Engineering Council of India (ECI) in this regard so that
                                            the quality of graduates could be enhanced and thereby their employability. ECI
                                            & AICTE have entered into an MoU, for providing “Internship” to the students
                                            in all disciplines of technical education to enable them to become employable.
                                            ECI shall be facilitating hands-on training/internship for these graduates through
                                            its member associations, in their respective stream of engineering. For those
                                            engineers/technologists who are already employed, it is important that they undergo
                                            Continued Professional Development (CPD) so as to upgrade their knowledge and
                                            skills and prepare themselves for required role in the industry. This is necessary
                                            in view of rapid technological advancements in all spheres of engineering activities.

                                            Learning to build a modern web application is daunting. But Ruby on Rails makes it much easier and more fun. It includes
                                            everything needed to build fantastic applications. Ruby on rails is open source
                                            and is used to make websites like Basecamp, Github, Shopify, Twitch, Hulu etc.
                                            Realizing the above need, HASHes programming club in association with Coding
                                            ninjas organized a two day workshop on web and game development using Ruby on
                                            Rails and Django. The agenda of the workshop was to enlighten the students with
                                            basics of ruby language, create server using Sinatra and then implement the gained
                                            knowledge to make something productive. A day before the workshop students from
                                            coding ninja helped the students to install ruby, rails and Sinatra. Day 1 began
                                            with introduction of ruby as a programming language. A quick glance of datatypes,
                                            arithmetic operations, conditions, functions, classes and objects in ruby was
                                            given. Later use of Sinatra was brought into action to dynamically update data
                                            on server. After touching briefly on these, day 2 was mostly focused on developing
                                            a dynamic To-do List. Under the guidance, students made their very first application
                                            using Ruby on Rails and were asked to add more innovative features to it.

                                            Cloud services covers a wide range of resources that a service provider delivers to customers via the internet. Customers
                                            can provision services on an on-demand basis and shut them down when no longer
                                            necessary. On-demand computing services can save large enterprises and small
                                            businesses a lot of money, but security and regulatory compliance become difficult.
                                            He emphasised that these systems may present a variety of potential security
                                            risks that could be exploited to harm consumers. He discussed the privacy concerns
                                            that arise and how we can address them effectively.

                                            A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers
                                            as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable
                                            access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.

                                            IoT can be described as the connection of physical objects to the Internet and to each other through small, embedded sensors
                                            and wired and wireless technologies, creating an ecosystem of ubiquitous computing. The IoT includes consumer-facing
                                            devices, as well as products and services that are not consumer-facing. The Internet of Things extends internet connectivity
                                            beyond traditional devices like desktop and laptop computers, smartphones and tablets to a diverse range of devices and

                                        </h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Despite numerous benefits these systems create a number of security and privacy risks.
                                            <br>
                                            <strong> 1. Data Breaches</strong>
                                            <br> He cited that the largest breaches haven't involved any such advanced techniques, which remain for the most part lab
                                            experiments. But the possibility still acts as a brake on what is looking like broad enterprise adoption of cloud computing.
                                            Clouds represent concentrations of corporate applications and data, and if any intruder penetrated far enough, who knows
                                            how many sensitive pieces of information will be exposed. Unfortunately, while data loss and data leakage are both serious
                                            threats to cloud computing, the measures you put in place to mitigate one of these threats can exacerbate the other.
                                            Encryption protects data at rest, but lose the encryption key and you've lost the data. The cloud routinely makes copies
                                            of data to prevent its loss due to an unexpected die off of a server. The more copies, the more exposure you have to
                                            breaches.

                                            <strong> 2. Data Loss</strong>
                                            <br> A data breach is the result of a malicious and probably intrusive action. Data loss may occur when a disk drive dies
                                            without its owner having created a backup. It occurs when the owner of encrypted data loses the key that unlocks it.
                                            And a data loss could occur intentionally in the event of a malicious attack.

                                            <strong>3. Account Or Service Traffic Hijacking</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            <p>
                                                Account hijacking sounds too elementary to be a concern in the cloud, but it is a problem. Phishing, exploitation of software
                                                vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow attacks, and loss of passwords and credentials can all lead to the loss of
                                                control over a user account. An intruder with control over a user account can eavesdrop on transactions, manipulate
                                                data, provide false and business-damaging responses to customers, and redirect customers to a competitor's site or
                                                inappropriate sites.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                If your account in the cloud is hijacked, it can be used as a base by an attacker to use the power of your reputation to
                                                enhance himself at your expense.

                                            <p>
                                                If credentials are stolen, the wrong party has access to an individual's accounts and systems. A service hijacking lets an
                                                intruder into critical areas of a deployed service with the possibility of "compromising the confidentiality, integrity,
                                                and availability" of those services, the report said.

                                            <strong>Data security</strong>
                                            <br> Participants discussed a number of specific security best practices. He encouraged companies to consider these practices:
                                            First companies should implement security by design by buikding security into their devices at the outset , rather than
                                            as an afterthought.in addition. Companies should do a privacy or security risk assessment , consciously considering the
                                            risks presented by collection and retention of cosumer information. Secondly , companies must ensure that their personnel
                                            practices should promote good security. Companies should also train their employees about good security practices recognizing
                                            that technical expertise does not necessarily equate to security expertise. Data minimization. Companies should examine
                                            their data practices and business needs and develop policies and practices that impose reasonable limits on the collection
                                            and retention of consumer data. Data minimization can help guard against two privacy related risks. Companies should
                                            also consider if it could offer same features while collecting less information. With these recommendations on data minimization,
                                            he is mindful of the need to balance future.

                                            the sharing of account credentials between users, including trusted business partners; and to implement strong two-factor

                                            The cloud services and internet of things presents numerous benefits to consumers and has potential to change the ways that
                                            consumers interact with technology in fundamental ways. In future these systems are likely to meld the virtual and physical
                                            worlds together in ways that are currently difficult to comprehend. From a security and privacy perspective these bodies
                                            pose particular challenges. As physical objects in our everyday lives increasingly detect and share observations about
                                            us, consumers will likely want privacy. The designated commission will continue to enforce laws, educate consumers and
                                            businesses, and engage with industry and academics to promote appropriate security and privacy protections. At the same
                                            time, he urged further self-regulatory efforts on IoT, along with enactment of data security and broad based privacy
                                            legislation.
